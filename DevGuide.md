Development Guidelines
======================
* Commit messages will be phrased as `[present tense verb] [description]` (eg "Fix broken test")
* Each major feature will be developed on a separate branch, to submit via Pull Request when ready
* Once a PR is submitted, it enters into "code review" during which Adam/John will leave comments on changes to be made
* Once a PR has been given a **+1**, it can be merged into master

**Golden Rule: No direct commits to master ever**
